# PLOPL

## Trustless Off-Chain to On-Chain Integration

PLOPL is a developer-friendly toolkit that enables trustless integration of off-chain data to on-chain systems. Using zkTLS technology, PLOPL allows API calls made in a user's browser to be cryptographically verified and tamper-proof.

## What Problem Does PLOPL Solve?

Blockchain applications often need trusted data from off-chain sources, but this traditionally creates centralization risks or requires complex oracle solutions. PLOPL bridges this gap by enabling:

- Trustless verification of API responses
- Direct browser-to-contract data flow
- Simple developer implementation
- User-controlled data sovereignty

## How It Works

PLOPL leverages zero-knowledge proofs to verify the authenticity of API calls. When a user interacts with a supported API, the PLOPL extension:

1. Intercepts or monitors the API call
2. Verifies the response against a predefined schema
3. Generates a cryptographic proof (pProof)
4. Makes this proof available for on-chain verification

The result is a tamper-proof attestation that specific off-chain data was genuinely received by the user's browser.

## User Flow

### For Developers:
1. **Create a Proof Schema** - Define what API calls and responses should be verified, with an intuitive interface (AI-assisted schema creation available)
2. **Deploy Proof Registry** - Once created, the proof schema is deployed and available for anyone to use
3. **Integrate with Frontend** - Implement PLOPL verification on your frontend to guide users through the proof generation process
4. **Utilize Backend Services** - Each proof type includes webhooks and indexing via nodit, making off-chain verification easy

### For End Users:
1. Install the PLOPL browser extension
2. Visit a PLOPL-integrated application
3. Follow guided steps to generate proofs when needed
4. Submit transactions with cryptographic verification of off-chain data

## Example Use Cases

### Voting Verification
Verify that a user has genuinely cast 10 votes for "Project A" on a voting platform like Kaito. PLOPL intercepts calls to `https://api.kaito.ai/my-votes`, verifies the data matches the expected schema, and generates a proof that can be used in smart contracts.

### NFT Eligibility
Prove ownership of digital assets across platforms without sharing credentials.

### Credit Scoring
Verify financial information from traditional systems without exposing sensitive data.

### Game Achievements
Prove in-game accomplishments for on-chain rewards without requiring the game to be fully on-chain.
